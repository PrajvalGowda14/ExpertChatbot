# Expert Chatbot - GenBot Expo 2025 Submission

## 🔍 Project Overview
 
Expert Chatbot is a web-based generative AI system that enables users to interact with specialized AI personas in real-time. It utilizes the Cohere Command LLM to simulate domain-specific experts such as:

* ♟️ Chess Coach
* 📸 Vintage Camera Expert
* 🏁 Formula 1 Analyst
* 🏋️‍♂️ Fitness Coach
* 🧠 Tech Advisor
* ✍️ Custom Chatbot (defined by the user)

This project showcases how prompt engineering and dynamic UI/UX design can empower users to create and interact with expert systems without needing technical knowledge.

* Education
* Personal development
* Hobbyist research
